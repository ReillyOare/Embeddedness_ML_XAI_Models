From Jones:

"Here are two spreadsheets of DEQ sites with ref/intermediate/stress (column B) based on benthic macroinvertebrate assessment by our regional biologist staff. These split up coastal and non-coastal sites for our MMI work. Note: all collections are a freshwater, free flowing, perennial streams per our sample frame, but for our MMI work our coastal sites perform very differently than upland sites."

Can be joined to rest of Virginia datasets.
