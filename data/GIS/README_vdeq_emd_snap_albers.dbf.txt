This is a GIS file providing tabular coordinates for the VA DEQ monitoring sites. *These are specifically snapped to the StreamStats grid required to use the StreamStats batch processor.*

It is projected to Albers Conic (same as StreamStats grid for Virginia). This can be joined to datasets using a Python module.
