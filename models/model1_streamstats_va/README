To follow the methods completed by the researcher, the order of the notebooks is:

1. Preprocessing --> /data_preprocessing/
1a. VADEQ_join_trim
--> Joins original two datasets provided by VA DEQ for full dataset.
1b. StreamStats_VADEQ_Clean
--> Loads dataset collected from the StreamStats Batch Processor based on the VA DEQ dataset provided. Joins two datasets (VA DEQ and StreamStats) and trims before exporting.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis --> /eda/
2a. VADEQ_EDA_and_Regression
--> This was studied since the dataset has information that could be used to calculate bankfull shear velocity. Regression was performed using the hypothesized relationships defined by Czuba et al., 2022.
2b. VADEQ_Stmsts_EDA
--> Conducted EDA on joined dataframe of VA DEQ and StreamStats datasets. EDA conducted: temporal variation based on station, correlation EDA (pearson's r), scatterplots against target, histograms.


3. Feature Engineering --> /data_preprocessing/
1a. VADEQ_StreamStats_Feature_Engineering
--> Applies transformations to necessary features for later model building using traditional statistical methods and power transformations. 

4. Model Buildng --> /training/
--> Builds and evaluates four different ML models (Random Forest, ANN, Gradient Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting)

5. Evaluation --> /evaluation/
--> Conducts accuracy, explainability analysis, etc. Provides all figures found in /results/figures/
